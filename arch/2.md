# Introduction
[Arch](#) is certainly not the Linux distro you should cut your teeth on. If you're
just getting into it, start with something simpler like [Ubuntu](#). If you've been a Linux
user for a while and know your way around the command line, and would like to dive
deeper into the guts of the system, Arch may be the way to go.

## Disclaimer
Neither I nor any contributors to this guide are responsible for any damage incurred to your system.
You should have at least basic knowledge of each command you are running.
**Never trust anything from the internet!**


# Create ISO

## Download Arch Image
A live Arch image can be downloaded from the [official Downloads page](https://www.archlinux.org/download/).
It can be burned to a CD or USB flash drive in a variety of ways.

**Installing from a unix system:** `dd if=/path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdX status=progress oflag=sync`

# Partition Disks

## Partition Options

## Writing Filesystems

* mkswap
* swapon

# Base Installation

## Choose Mirror


# chroot Stuff
To enter into the newly-created Linux system, run `arch-chroot /mnt`.
This will start a command prompt as if you had booted into the system,
but the live image is still the one actually running.

## Locale

* rm -rf /etc/localtime
* ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/*Region*/*City* /etc/localtime
* hwclock --systohc --utc
* locale.gen
* locale-gen
* locale.conf

## Installing a Bootloader


# Boot and Package Installation


# X Installation


# WM Installation


# Post-Installation

# Helpful Commands

## Pacman
Pacman commands must be run as root.

* **Update all packages:** `pacman -Syu`
* **Remove Package:** `pacman -Rns <package>`

## Bash

## Editors

### nano

* **Exit:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>

### vim

* **Edit:** <kbd>i</kbd>, or <kbd>A</kbd> to start at end of line
* **Exit:** <kbd>Esc</kbd> to enter command mode, then `:wq`
