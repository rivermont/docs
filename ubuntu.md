# Ubuntu
This guide is mostly aimed at myself, for when I am reinstalling Ubuntu on my machine(s), but it will hopefully be useful to others as well.

## Final Product
After following this guide, you will (hopefully) have a minimalistic installation of Ubuntu 18.04 Linux, with the following features and more:

* i3wm (i3-gaps)
* Support for multiple monitors and hot-swapping them
* A working sound system using Pulseaudio
* Support for various media types
* Steam, with games working

## My Setup
These instructions are slightly tailored to my equipment but many of the workarounds I use will solve problems on other systems.  
I have a Dell Inspiron 7559 laptop, which has multiple issues regarding a) it's discrete NVidia 960M graphics card, b) that's about it.
