# Ubuntu
This guide is mostly aimed at myself, for when I am reinstalling Ubuntu on my machine(s), but it will hopefully be useful to others as well.

## Final Product
After following this guide, you should hopefully have a fully functional machine with:

* Ubuntu 18.04 Linux
* i3wm (i3-gaps)
* A working sound system using Pulseaudio
* Support for various media types
* Steam, with games working
